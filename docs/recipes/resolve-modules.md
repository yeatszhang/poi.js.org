# Resolve modules without dot hell

In a large project you may have a deep nested folder structure, for example, if you want to require `$project/src/components/Header.vue` in `$project/src/views/Home/guest/index.vue`, you have to write something like:

```js
import Header from '../../components/Header.vue'
```

It's easy to make mistake by introducing the [dot hell](https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook#avoiding-).

Instead, as many people use `src` folder as the main directory for their app, you can also use `@` to indicate the path to `src` folder, then it becomes:

```js
import Header from '@/components/Header.vue'
```

注意less的资源引入方式，参考 [https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader#webpack-resolver](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader#webpack-resolver)

```less
@import "~@/styles/variables.less";
```

Please note, the use of alias will make path tips and IDE IntelliSense no longer work.  

You can solve this problem by configuring [jsconfig.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig#_using-webpack-aliases) if you're using VSCode:
 
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    },
    "target": "ES6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"
  ]
}
```
